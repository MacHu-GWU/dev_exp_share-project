Overview
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
在 :ref:`cloud-migration-overview` 一文中介绍了我们可以从两个维度 Migration Strategy 和 Migration Task 来考虑 Cloud Migration. 本文给出了一个比较通用的 step-by-step Roadmap, 无论这两个维度如何排列组合, 做项目的时候都可以按照这个框架去做.


1. Initial Assessment and Planning
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Define Objectives: Understand why you are migrating. Common reasons include cost reduction, performance improvement, or accessing new features. Determine the scope of migration (full or partial).
- Assess Current Environment: Document the current hardware software situation, data specification, and workload information. Identify dependencies, integrations, and any potential challenges.
- Choose Target Platform: Based on your objectives, research and select the target platform. Consider factors such as cost, performance, scalability, and compatibility with existing applications.
- Skill and Resource Assessment: Ensure your team has or can gain the necessary skills for the new platform. Assess if additional resources or tools are needed for the migration.


2. Detailed Planning and Design
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Migration Strategy: Decide on a migration strategy (big bang, trickle, or phased approach) based on your risk tolerance and downtime allowance. Develop a detailed migration plan including timeline, milestones, and roles/responsibilities.
- Application Modification Plan: Identify necessary changes to applications due to the migration. Plan for application code changes, connection updates, and testing.


3. Testing and Preparation
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Environment Setup: Set up development, testing, and staging environments that mirror the production setup as closely as possible.
- Data Migration Testing: Conduct a trial migration on the test environment. Assess the data integrity, performance, and any issues encountered.
- Application Testing: Update application connections to the test database.Perform thorough testing to ensure all functionalities work as expected with the new system.


4. Execution
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Finalize Migration Scripts and Processes: Based on testing feedback, finalize all scripts and processes for migration and application updates.
- Communication Plan: Inform all stakeholders of the migration timeline and expected impacts.
- Downtime Planning: Schedule the migration during a low-usage period if downtime is required. Ensure backups are taken before starting the migration.


5. Migration and Monitoring
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Execute Migration: Follow the detailed migration plan to start the migration process. Monitor the migration closely for any issues.
- Validation: Conduct post-migration testing to validate data integrity and application functionality.
- Performance Tuning: Monitor the new platform for performance issues and tune as necessary.


6. Contingency and Rollback Planning
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Plan B: Have a rollback plan in case of critical failure, including restoring from backups.
- Contingency Plans: Prepare for possible issues like longer-than-expected downtime, data corruption, or performance problems.


7. Post-Migration
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Documentation: Update documentation with the new configurations, and any changes made during the migration.
- Training: Provide necessary training to the team on the new platform.
- Monitoring and Optimization: Continuously monitor the system for any issues and optimize performance as needed.
- Decommission Old Platform: Once confident in the stability of the new system, decommission the old system system. Remember, detailed planning, thorough testing, and having a robust rollback plan are key to a successful migration.
